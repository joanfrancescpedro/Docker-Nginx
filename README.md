# Docker Nginx

Greetings my friend, welcome to this project.

Many of you will think what is this project about. Well, is the creation of a Docker container with a Dockerfile, using the Alpine image as base:

## Getting Started

This project is made in linux, and I will not solve you'r problems in other systems (aham aham Windows... Sorry for the cough), for the moment, so these are projects to practicing Docker skills.
I've tried so simplify your life, so here you have the steps to enjoy the project doing almost nothing:

1. Clone or download this project, if you don'k know the spell, here you have it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/socunzombi/DevOps-Projects
```
2. Use the following magic spells (simply copy and paste the following code in the same terminal you made the previous step):
```bash
chmod +x docker-script.sh
./docker-script.sh
```
3. Greetings my friend, you have been hacked.
4. The previous step was a joke, there is nothing bad in those projects..... or maybe yes...
