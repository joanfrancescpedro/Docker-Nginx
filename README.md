## Introduction

This repository is my secret lair of DevOps wizardry. From turning servers into party animals to making automation scripts tell dad jokes, I believe that DevOps should not only be efficient but also entertaining. Dive into the projects, and brace yourself for a wild ride!

## Projects

1. [Project: Docker-nginx](./Docker-nginx): First project, go to the middle earth to explore the containerization of the Sauron's webpage.

## Getting Started

This projects are made in linux, and I will not solve you'r problems in other systems (for the moment).
I've tried so simplify your life, so here you have the steps to enjoy the projecto doing almost nothing:

1. Clone or download this project, if you don'k know the spell, here you have it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/socunzombi/DevOps-Projects
```
2. Use the following magic spells (simply copy and paste the following code in the same terminal you made the previous step):
```bash
cd DevOps-Projects
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
3. Greetings my friend, you have been hacked.
4. The previous step was a joke, there is nothing bad in those projects..... or maybe yes...

## Contributing

Feel like adding a punchline or two? Contributions are more than welcome!

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your comedic masterpiece: `git checkout -b feature-standup`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Added a hilarious twist'`.
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin feature-standup`.
5. Open a pull request.
6. Wait untill my anser, maybe takes 1 day, maybe 2 breackfast, maybe 1 light year.
